DRAGDROP(1)

# NAME

dragdrop - file drag-and-drop source

# SYNOPSIS

*dragdrop* [*-ophv*] [_files_...]

# DESCRIPTION

The *dragdrop* utility acts as a source or sink
for dragging and dropping files into programs running in a terminal emulator.

When started with file names as its arguments,
it will display those files in a window
from which they can be dragged into a graphical application,
like a file manager or web browser.
If started with no files specified,
the window will act as a sink in which files can be dropped
and their paths will be printed to the standard output.

The options are as follows:

*-o, --once*
	Exit after a single drag or drop.

*-u, --uris*
	Print URIs instead of file paths on drop.

*-h, --help*
	Show help information, then exit.

*-v, --version*
	Show version information, then exit.
